            <img src="images/spiritombIcon.gif" ALIGN="left" style="width:60px;height:60px;"/>
            together in order to have an archive of interesting and useful information
            about the 4th Generation of Pokemon Games. Whether you're a casual player or
            a seasoned shiny hunting veteran, I hope you find something useful
            while looking around!</p>

                A new tool has dropped! I'm super excited for this one. If you ever need some inspiration on deciding your next shiny hunt, check out the new <a href="pages/fun/huntGenerator" class="link">Shiny Hunt Generator!</a> This is a community project and I'd love to have people submit their own hunt ideas! Over time the plan is to build up a huge database of Gen 4 hunts that the page can randomly grab from. I've started us off with a few of my favorites, but I'll add more as I think of them and receive them!

                Is full odds hunting too daunting? Want something that requires a little more brainpower, but a good amount of luck? The <a href="pages/guides/radar" class="link">Pokeradar Guide</a> is up! I've always loved shiny hunting with the Radar, and I can only hope this guide gives you some encouragement to try it out for yourself!
            </p><br> 

            <p> <span id="date">04/19/2024 ---</span> 
                Working hard on the Pokeradar Page right now! In the meantime, we've now affiliated with 
                <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/" target="_blank" class="link">The Cave of Dragonflies</a>, one of my favorite and most visited sites, absolutely
                filled with info from basically every generation! And another new friend, 
                <a href="https://noseclub.bluwiikoon.art/index.shtml" target="_blank" class="link">Noseclub</a>, a site full of game mechanics and incredible art!
            </p><br>

                Looking for some easier ways to level up in Gen 4? Don't feel like farming with the Vs. Seeker? Grab some Rare Candy! The <a href="pages/guides/rareCandy" class="link">Farming Rare Candy</a> page is live! I did my best to research the best, more streamlined methods for this, and tried to make sure everything you needed to know was all in one spot! 
            </p><br> 

            <p> <span id="date">03/27/2024 ---</span> 
                I've been hard at work doing some research and gathering up some information on the DNS Exploit, and now the page is finally live!
                You can check it out <a href="pages/guides/dnsExploit" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>. I still plan on updating the page, and want to add a tool
                using JavaScript to make finding the date a little more streamlined. I'm also working on a Rare Candy Farming page, which should be 
                up soon!
            </p><br> 

            <p> <span id="date">03/19/2024 ---</span> 
                A bit of a makeover, I redid the logo and plan on fixin up the site a little bit. As for updates, I added the <a href="pages/guides/magikarp" class="link">Resort Area Magikarp</a>
                page! This is probably my favorite event in Platinum and highly recommend you try it out. We also added <a href="https://buriedrelic.neocities.org/" class="link">
                Buried Relic</a> as a new affiliate! One of the most gorgeous sites around, it's full of neat stuff like guides on how to Hunt Shadow Pokemon in XD and 
                Colosseum, a Dangerous Move Checker (something I use all the time while shiny hunting) and more!
            </p><br> 

            <p> <span id="date">03/18/2024 ---</span> 
                We've made some friends! We're now affiliates with <span class="link">Pamtre Berry</span>! A lovely little site where you can play browser-based recreations of some GBA and DS era Pokemon minigames, like a Secret Base decorator and a Dress-Up minigame.
            </p><br>         

            <p> <span id="date">03/16/2024 ---</span> 
                The site is officially live @ HallowedTower.net! Super excited to see it out on the interwebs. The top priority at the moment is working out a more responsive layout, and with that, making a mobile friendly site. Lots to do still, but the skeleton is here!
