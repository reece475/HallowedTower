            <p>
                While modern games make the Gen 4 Pokemon games seem small by comparison, the player would be surprised to find there
                are still plenty of areas they may never have explored, despite playing the games for years. I asked some friends and
                did some personal exploration to try and find some forgotten or relatively unknown areas in the Gen 4 games. Please note,
                these are just personal picks, and this webpage is, at its core, simply for fun. If you have any recommendations, 
                email me at <a href="mailto: reece@hallowedtower.net" class="link">reece@hallowedtower.net</a> and let me know!

            <h2>Lake Verity, Valor, and Acuity</h2>
            <p>
                While the player would probably spend their time at each Lake either continuing the story
                or catching the legendary of the Lake, there are actually more areas that the player can easily miss
                if they don't look for them. Across each lake, on the opposite shore from where you enter, there are large
                patches of grass. These can be used to more easily encounter Pokemon than the smaller patches of grass,
                as well as being perfect for Radar Hunting.
            </p><br>

            </div><br>

            <h2>Eterna Forest Shortcut</h2>
            <p>
                This was something I only recently found while working on the <a href="../guides/honeyTrees" class="link">Honey Trees</a> page.
                If you have cut, there is a narrow passage containing a Honey Tree that allows you to cut through Eterna Forest. There are two entrances:
                one to the right of the entrance of Eterna Forest, and one below the exit of Eterna Forest (to the left of Eterna City).
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">

                    <figcaption>
                        You can enter the passage by cutting the tree by the entrance or exit of Eterna Forest.
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
            </div><br>

            <h2>Fuego Ironworks</h2>
            <p>
               While this one may be more well known, I'd argue it is still an area that few players
               have actually spent time going to or hunting in. To the right of Floaroma Town, you can surf off
               of the left side of the bridge, and following the water North will take you to the Ironworks. From here you can also get to
               the back half of Floaroma Meadows, which will be next.
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">

                </fig>
            </div><br>

            <h2>Back of Floaroma Meadow</h2>
            <p>
               From the Fuego Ironworks, you are able to enter the back half of the Floaroma Meadow. There are quite a few items
               here, and is arguably one of the prettiest areas in the game. 
            </p><br>

            </div><br>

            <h2>Regi Caves</h2>
            <p>
               Making their debut in Gen 3, the Regis have always had a background in puzzles. In Gen 4, the player is able
               to get Regigigas in the basement of Snowpoint Temple if they bring the other 3 Regis in their party. While in D/P the
               only way to do this was transferring from Gen 3, in Platinum they added special areas for each Regi, which are opened
               when the player has an event Regigigas in their party.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Right of Pastoria</h2>
            <p>
               While exploring for this webpage I found this area, and in my nearly 15 years of playing
               D/P/Pt I've never seen it before! If you surf to the right of Pastoria City there is a small passage
               where you can find the Mystic Water, as well as two large boats docked nearby.
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">
                <fig>

                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
            </div><br>

            <h2>Hall of Origin</h2>
            <p>
               You could hardly be blamed if you've never seen this area in game, as the only way to get
               to it was an unreleased event using the Azure Flute. Taking it to the top of Spear Pillar will
               prompt the player to play the flute, creating a large staircase that leads here, where you can catch Arceus.
            </p><br>

            </div><br>

            <h2>Sendoff Spring</h2>
            <p>
               While in Platinum the player is sent to this area after finishing the Distortion World, in Diamond and Pearl
               this area could be easily passed by if the player never bothered going to Turnback Cave and catching Giratina.
            </p><br>

            </div><br>

            <h2>Route 221</h2>
            <p>
               This Route is generally forgotten, due to the player's ability to fly to Pal Park directly, and simply because there is no incentive
               to visit it unless you're on your way to unlock Pal Park. I've always loved this branching corridor of trees, and try to
               visit this route in each playthrough to battle the trainers and soak up some extra EXP.

            <h1 id="chapter2areas"><u>HG/SS</u></h1>

            <h2>Route 47 Grass Patch</h2>
            <p>
               This one was recommended by <a href="https://twitch.tv/Kwikpanik" class="link">@Kwikpanik</a>. On Route 47, there is
               a small patch of grass that can be accessed when the player has Waterfall. This is the area with the highest % of
               encountering Ditto, at 41%.
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">

            </div><br>

            <h2>Nat Dex Headbutt Trees</h2>
            <p>
               These were recommended by <a href="https://youtube.com/@SirToastyToes" class="link">@SirToastyToes</a> and
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/shinycollector" class="link">@ShinyCollector</a>. 
               Once the player has Rock Climb, there are multiple trees in the post-game of HGSS that will give special National Dex Pokemon, such
               as Cherrim, Taillow, and more.
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">

                        Two of the small areas containing these post-game headbutt trees. <br>

                </fig>
            </div><br>

            <h2>Mt. Mortar Karate King</h2>
            <p>
               This was also recommended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/shinycollector" class="link">@ShinyCollector</a>. 
               Even after being told about this, I had to go online to look up the proper route to take to get to this area. In Mt. Mortar, there 
               is a small nook you can take in order to get to the Karate King, who will gift you a Tyrogue after beating him.
            </p><br>

            <div class="imageCenter">

            <h2>Giovanni's Cave</h2>
            <p>
               This is another really neat WiFi event that many players likely haven't seen. Having an event Celebi in the front of your party and heading
               to the Ilex Forest Shrine will trigger an event where Celebi will send you and Lyra 3 years into the future and 3 years into the past.
               This will allow the player to fight Giovanni in a cave, before sending them back to the current time in Ilex Forest.
            </p><br>

            <h2>Sinjoh Ruins</h2>
            <p>
               This is possibly my favorite event in Gen 4. If you take an Arceus at the front of your party to the small research
               center in the Ruins of Alph, you will be transported to the Sinjoh Ruins, where you can meet with Cynthia, and partake
               in an event that will give you a Level 1 Dialga, Palkia, or Giratina.
