                Hi! My name is Reece, but online I also go by Ronk. I'm a 22 year old Canadian shiny hunter and streamer. I made this website after being inspired
                by other fansites like <a href="https://bluemoonfalls.com" class="link">bluemoonfalls.com</a> and <a href="https://dragonflycave.com" class="link">dragonflycave.com</a>, and figured that I would try to make a site where I can compile all of the info I know about
                in the 4th Generation Sinnoh games into one spot. Most, if not all, of the stuff on this site is taken from other places on the internet, I've just put it all here
                together so people can use it! The equations and backend stuff in the Pokemon games were discovered by people much more talented than I, and I've simply just coded these equations into the site so people are able to use them more easily!

            <p> When I was 8 years old I got my very first Pokemon game, Pokemon Pearl. I had religiously played through all of Gen 3 prior, borrowing cartridges from friends who had older siblings. After I got my own copies of D/P/Pt and HG/SS I played THOSE religiously. One day I came across shiny hunting on YouTube, and learned that by resetting thousands of times there was a chance the Pokemon could be shiny. I never ended up finishing my first hunt, which was Lugia, but I eventually took up Pokeradar instead, after learning that the chances of finding a shiny were better. I ended up finding my very first shiny, a Budew appropriately named FIRST SHNY, and have been pretty hooked on shiny hunting ever since.

            <p>Around 2022 I decided to start <a href="https://twitch.tv/ronk475">streaming</a> shiny hunting, and I haven't really stopped since. I always have some sort of hunt going, sometimes multiple at a time, and hanging out with chat alongside hunting is one of my favorite things to do in my free time. I eventually started making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ronk475">YouTube</a> videos on these hunts, and now, this website! So I appreciate you all stopping by and reading this, if you haven't checked out my channels feel free, and best of luck on whatever sort of Pokemon Endeavors you've got lined up!
