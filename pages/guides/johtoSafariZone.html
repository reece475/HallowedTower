            <p>
                One of the most complex and interesting areas in Generation 4 is the Johto Safari Zone. Located northwest of Cianwood, players are able to access it after healing Amphy at the Olivine City lighthouse. Building upon previous iterations, such as the Kanto Safari Zone and Great Marsh, the Johto Safari Zone has all the usual hallmarks of a Safari Zone: Pokemon that will flee, a set amount of Safari Balls, and options that will raise or lower the capture and flee rate of the Pokemon; in this case throwing bait or mud. It is unique, however, in the fact that there is no step counter; the player can only leave through retiring, exiting through the entrance, or retiring through their menu.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                However the most unique aspect of the Johto Safari Zone is the habitat and block system, which allows the player to control which Pokemon will spawn within their Safari Game. There are 12 different habitats, being: Peak, Desert, Plains, Meadow, Forest, Swamp, Marshland, Mountain, Rocky Beach, Wasteland, Savannah, and Wetland. After completing Baoba's missions, the player will be able to customize these areas to their whim.
            </p><br>

            <h2 id="chapter2safari">Baoba's Challenges</h2>
            <div class="notice">
                <p>
                    <u>First Challenge:</u> <br>
                    When the player first enters the Safari Zone, Baoba will challenge them to find and catch a Geodude. This is made easier for the player as the Peak Area, where Geodude can be found, will always be the first area the player enters when starting their Safari Game. <br>      
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <u>Second Challenge:</u><br>
                    After 3 hours of <b>IN GAME TIME</b> after the first challenge, Baoba will call the player again. Baoba will not call the player while they are inside the Safari Zone, however playtime inside the Safari Zone will count towards the 3 hours wait time. The player has to use the Area Customizer in order to add the Desert Biome, and then catch a Sandshrew to show to Baoba.
                </p>
            </div><br>

            <h2 id="chapter3safari">Habitat Customization</h2>
            <p>
                When the player initially enters the Safari Zone, there are 10 different default layouts they may get. In every arrangement, the Peak Area will be the area the player enters into, in order to facilitate the First Challenge. As well, the Desert will not be present in any of the 10 layouts, in order to facilitate the Second Challenge.

                After receiving the National Dex, and at least 3 in-game hours after completing the Second Challenge, the player will get a call from Boaba and be able to place blocks within the habitats, which will affect which Pokemon spawn. A player can place up to 30 blocks within each Habitat at a time. Initially, the player will have access to 6 block items. After 3 in game hours, Baoba will grant access to 6 more items. This continues 2 more times until the player has all 24 block items.

                These blocks, when placed, will affect which Pokemon will spawn in each area. Some Pokemon will begin to appear as soon as the objects are placed, while other Pokemon require a specific amount of time to pass with a habitat set within your 6 zones. An important distinction to note is that you do not need to have the <u>objects themselves</u> placed for a certain amount of days, rather, the habitat itself will upgrade itself as time goes on. Objects gain strength the longer a Habitat is active, and therefore will reduce the number of objects required to attract Pokemon. This strength will not be reverted, even if the Habitat is removed from your active zones.

            <p>
                Like most time based events in Gen 4, you do not need to actively play to pass the time for the habitats. However, if you switch the game from one console to another, or change the clock, the counter will freeze for 24 hours once you save the game (We use the same type of shenanigans to allow us to keep <a href="/pages/guides/honeyTrees" class="link">Honey Trees</a> for more than 24 hours as long as we don't save).

                        As stated on Bulbapedia, all encounter slots in the Safari Zone are 10% each, and  “all block-based encounters will replace the topmost available slot, with the higher ID being prioritized”.

                        When encountering a Pokemon, the game will reroll the IVs up to 4 times if none of the IVs are 31.
