        <h2 id="chapter1dns">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Nintendo Wifi Connection officially shut down on May 20th 2014 for the DS.
            With this, we lost the ability to use the WiFi Rooms in D/P/Pt, the ability to
            trade and battle online, and the ability to use Wifi to receive special Mystery Gifts. Luckily, 
            the good folks behind Wiimmfi created fan made DNS servers in 2014, single 
            handedly resurrecting online play for the Nintendo DS and Wii. 
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="chapter2dns">What You'll Need</h2>
        <p>To get this working on Gen 4, you will need:</p>
        <ul class="important" style="list-style: none;">
            <li>-Any DS console (DS Fat, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS)</li>
            <li>-A copy of any Gen 4 Pokemon game (D/P/Pt, HG/SS)</li>
            <li>-An open/unsecure WiFi Connection<span style="text-decoration: underline ;">***</span></li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline ;">***</span>
            This is the biggest bottleneck for Gen 4 Wifi. The original DS and 
            Gen 4 games only support WEP encryption. WPA and WPA2 will NOT work. 
            Therefore, you'll need a way to create an unsecure Wifi connection. I personally 
            use my Google Pixel 5 in order to create an unsecure hotspot, and most other Android
            phones should be able to do the same. If you are an iPhone user and have
            no access to an Android phone, you'll have to mess with your router in order to open
            an unsecure Guest Wifi. I recommend either making this hidden, or whitelisting ONLY your
            Nintendo DS, as this is somewhat dangerous to leave open. If this isn't possible, your
            only other option is to grab an older router that allows WEP connection.
        </p><br>

            THIS</a> router, (TrendNet N300 Wirelesss Router TEW-731BR Version 1.0R) which has worked for him. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CannedWolfMeat" target="_blank" class="link">@CannedWolfMeat</a> also supplied <a href="../images/dnsExploit/router_list.png" target="_blank" class="link">official router list</a>  from Nintendo UK, which is from a webpage that is now offline.<br>
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="chapter3dns">How to Set Up</h2>
        <p>First, you'll have to unlock Mystery Gifts on your game.</p>
        <dl class="highlightSection">
            <li>In HeartGold/SoulSilver</li>
            <dd>-Mystery Gift is unlocked by default</dd>
            <li>In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</li>
            <dd>-Play up until Jubilife City</dd>
            <dd>-Go to the TV Building, go to the third floor, and talk to the exec with glasses</dd>
            <dd>-Enter "EVERYONE HAPPY WIFI CONNECTION" using the EasyChat System (Use ABC mode, I find it slightly easier)</dd>
        </dl><br>

        <p>Next, you'll have to set up your connection.</p>
        <ul class="notice" style="list-style: none;">
            <li>1. Turn on your hotspot/WiFi</li>
            <li>2. Enter into D/P/Pt/HG/SS and enter the Wifi Connection menu (before clicking your save file)</li>
            <li>3. Connect to the hotspot normally and ensure you connect successfully</li>
            <li>4. Go into the connection settings and turn OFF "Auto Obtain DNS"</li>
            <li>5. <b><u>Primary DNS: 172.104.88.237</u></b></li>
            <li>6. <b><u>Secondary DNS: LEAVE as 0.0.0.0</u></b></li>
            <li>7. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR SETTINGS!</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>You should be all set now! Reset your DS, and head into System Settings to change the date.</p><br>

        <h2 id="chapter4dns">Mystery Gifts</h2>
        <p>
            Here are tables with all of the available mystery gifts for each game. The dates can be ignored, as the date system for the DNS Server is no longer working. Every gift can still be obtained with this method.
            <!--
            One of the previous servers I used to use would randomly give out mystery gifts from the
            pool of every available gift, which made it really annoying to get a specific gift.
            The genius of the 172.104.88.237 server is that it gives out a specific gift for a 
            specific date. This means you can get each gift you want simply by changing the date on
            your DS and connecting to the server. I've compiled a table for every English Gen 4 game,
            with each item and its corresponding date.
            <br><br>
            I'd also like to note, it seems that different language games have different dates for each item.
            These tables are for English only, at the moment.
